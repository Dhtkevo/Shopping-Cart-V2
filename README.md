## Reflection

This is a personal project I decided to work on to improve my React skillset, specifically managing somewhat complex global state. This project was challenging because it was the first time I implemented Client Side Routing (React Router) and managing global state with an unfamiliar framework (Redux Toolkit). The challenges I overcame while completing this project made for a very powerful learning experience. Some unexpected obstacles I encountered included properly updating the total price in shopping cart when adding items and resetting the cart once user purchases items.

React - Used as foundation for entire application.

React Router- Used to redirect user's between pages when clicking on a link or after completing a purchase.

Redux Toolkit - Used to manage global states such as shopping cart total, # of items in cart, etc..

TailWindCSS - Used to style the application. I find that tailwind makes styling with react very effecient.
